### Hosting

Stremio add-ons require hosting in order to be published. You need a NodeJS hosting solution, as stremio add-ons are NodeJS apps.

We recommend:

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - [free with some restrictions](https://www.heroku.com/pricing)
- [cloudno.de](https://cloudno.de) - [free for up to 150k requests/month](https://cloudno.de/pricing)
- [Evennode](https://www.evennode.com) - [free for 7 days trial](https://www.evennode.com/pricing)

You can also check this very comprehensive [guide by nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/wiki/node-hosting).

Stremio add-ons are deployed just like regular nodejs apps, so follow the nodejs instructions provided by your particular service provider.

If you've built a great add-on, and need help with hosting your add-on, you are welcome to contact us at [addons@strem.io](addons@strem.io)
